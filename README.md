# 11 Exercise Store Documentation

The API you can find at this [url](http://nodejs.clbo.dk/wp-json/) shows the content of an older version of this elective in an JSON API format.

The "front page" you see here describes which routes you can use and what type of HTTP verbs are accessable at these routes.

You should create something simular for your store api.
So at the url http://localhost:3000/api you should in json format describe what is possible in your api.    
It would also be a good idea to give the user some idea of what schema is accepted. E.g if you do a post in orders, what king of input is expected.

A much more detailed documentation template is avaliable [here](http://apidocjs.com/), you are also very welcome to use that.
